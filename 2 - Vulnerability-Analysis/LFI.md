# ðŸ“‚ Local File Inclusion (LFI)

## Overview
Local File Inclusion (LFI) allows attackers to include files on a server through the web browser.

## Steps to Test
1. Test with basic LFI payloads:
    ```bash
    ../../../../etc/passwd
    ```
2. Test different traversal levels and encodings.

## Tips
- Test inputs in URL parameters, form fields, and cookies.
- Verify if file contents are included in the response.
- Use tools like LFISuite to automate LFI testing.
