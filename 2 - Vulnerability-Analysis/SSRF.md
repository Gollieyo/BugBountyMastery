# 🌐 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## Overview
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) forces a server to make unauthorized requests on behalf of the attacker.

## Steps to Test
1. Test with internal URLs:
    ```bash
    http://internal-server/admin
    ```
2. Test with external URLs:
    ```bash
    http://example.com/proxy?url=http://evil.com
    ```

## Tips
- Test inputs in URL parameters, form fields, and headers.
- Verify responses and check for any unauthorized requests made by the server.
- Use tools like SSRFmap to automate the identification and exploitation of SSRF vulnerabilities.
