## Overview
Command Injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system.

## Steps to Test

    ```bash
    ; ls -la
    ```
2. Test for Windows environment:
    ```bash
    & dir
    ```

## Tips
- Test inputs in URL parameters, form fields, headers, and cookies.
- Check for execution of commands and their output.
- Use automated tools like Commix to identify and exploit command injection vulnerabilities.
