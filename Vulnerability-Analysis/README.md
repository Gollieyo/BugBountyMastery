# üõ†Ô∏è Vulnerability Analysis

**Purpose**: Identify weaknesses in the application's attack surfaces.

## Steps to Follow:
- Manually test for common vulnerabilities.
- Perform fuzzing to find hidden endpoints or parameters.
- Validate and confirm vulnerabilities.
- **Check for sensitive files and configurations**: Look for files like `robots.txt`, `.git`, `/.env`, or others that might disclose sensitive information.

## Tools:
- **Burp Suite**: Intercepts and manipulates traffic between client and server.

- **Dirb**: Brute-forces directories and files on the server.
    ```bash
    dirb https://example.com /path/to/wordlist.txt -o directories.txt
    ```

- **SQLmap**: Automates the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    ```bash
    sqlmap -u "https://example.com/page?parameter=value" --dbs
    ```

- **XSStrike**: Scans for XSS vulnerabilities and tests with various payloads.
    ```bash
    python3 xsstrike.py -u "https://example.com/search?q=test"
    ```

- **Gobuster**: A tool for directory and file busting, also supports DNS subdomain brute-forcing.
    ```bash
    gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
    ```

- **Nikto**: A web server scanner that detects vulnerabilities like outdated software, security misconfigurations, and more.
    ```bash
    nikto -h https://example.com
    ```

- **Retire.js**: A tool that scans for vulnerable JavaScript libraries.
    ```bash
    retire --path /path/to/project
    ```

## Key Tips:
- Always test edge cases and uncommon input combinations.
- Leverage the knowledge of popular vulnerabilities in open-source tools and frameworks.
