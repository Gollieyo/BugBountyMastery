# üõ†Ô∏è Command Injection Exploitation

## Overview
Command Injection exploitation involves leveraging vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system.

## Types of Exploitation
1. **Executing Basic Commands**:
    ```bash
    ; ls -la
    ```
2. **Windows Commands**:
    ```bash
    & dir
    ```

## Interactive Example
1. Test a vulnerable web application (e.g., DVWA) by inputting the payloads into form fields.
2. Observe the results in the application's response or server logs.

## Tools
- **Commix** for automated command injection testing:
    ```bash
    commix --url="http://example.com/vulnerable.php?param=value" --data="param=value"
    ```

## Tips
- Test in URL parameters, form fields, headers.
- Observe command outputs to confirm execution.
- Use encoded payloads to bypass filters.

## Real-World Scenarios
- Gaining unauthorized access to server files.
- Escalating privileges by chaining command injection with other vulnerabilities.
