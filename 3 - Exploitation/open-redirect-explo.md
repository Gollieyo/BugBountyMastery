# ðŸ”„ Open Redirect Exploitation

## Overview
Open Redirect exploitation involves leveraging vulnerabilities to redirect users to arbitrary websites.

## Example Payloads
1. Basic open redirect payload:
    ```bash
    http://example.com/?url=http://evil.com
    ```

## Interactive Example
1. Test a vulnerable web application by inputting the payloads into URL parameters or form fields.
2. Observe the redirection behavior to confirm exploitation.

## Tools
- **Burp Suite** for testing open redirects.

## Tips
- Test in URL parameters and form fields.
- Verify if arbitrary redirections are allowed.
- Combine open redirects with phishing attacks for advanced exploitation.

## Real-World Scenarios
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- Using open redirects in phishing campaigns.
