# üîê CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Exploitation

## Overview
CSRF exploitation involves forcing a user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated.

## Example Payloads
1. Basic GET request:
    ```html
    <img src="http://example.com/change?param=value">
    ```
2. POST request using a form:
    ```html
    <form action="http://example.com/change" method="POST">
        <input type="hidden" name="param" value="value">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    ```

## Interactive Example
1. Craft a CSRF payload and host it on your own web server.
2. Trick the victim into clicking the link or visiting the page.

## Tools
- **Burp Suite** for crafting and testing CSRF payloads.
- **OWASP ZAP** for automating CSRF testing.

## Tips
- Test for the presence of CSRF tokens.
- Validate CSRF protection by attempting unauthorized actions.
- Use social engineering techniques to exploit CSRF vulnerabilities.

## Real-World Scenarios
- Changing user passwords or email addresses.
- Submitting unauthorized transactions on banking sites.
