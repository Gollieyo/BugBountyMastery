# ðŸ“‚ LFI (Local File Inclusion) Exploitation

## Overview
LFI exploitation involves leveraging vulnerabilities to include files from the serverâ€™s file system.

## Example Payloads
1. Basic LFI payload:
    ```bash
    ../../../../etc/passwd
    ```

## Interactive Example
1. Test a vulnerable web application by inputting the payloads into URL parameters or form fields.
2. Observe the included file contents in the application's response.

## Tools
- **LFISuite** for automated LFI testing:
    ```bash
    python3 lfisuite.py --url "http://example.com/vulnerable.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd"
    ```

## Tips
- Test in URL parameters, form fields, cookies.
- Verify included file contents.
- Bypass filters with alternate encoding techniques.

## Real-World Scenarios
- Accessing server logs and configuration files.
- Escalating privileges by including sensitive files.
