# üêò Metasploit Auxiliary Modules

## Overview
Metasploit provides a range of **auxiliary modules** designed for information gathering, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and much more. These modules are a powerful part of Metasploit, often used before actual exploitation with exploits.

## Common Auxiliary Modules

### 1. **POP3 Brute Force**
This module is used for brute-forcing usernames and passwords against a POP3 service.

#### Steps to Test:
1. Select the **auxiliary** module for POP3 brute-forcing:
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/pop3/pop3_brute
    ```
2. Set the target IP and the wordlist for brute-forcing:
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS <target-ip>
    set USER_FILE /path/to/userlist.txt
    set PASS_FILE /path/to/passwordlist.txt
    ```
3. Run the module:
    ```bash
    run
    ```

#### Tips:
- Ensure the password list is appropriate for the target system.
- Try common usernames like `admin`, `root`, or the target's domain name.

### 2. **HTTP Login Scanner**
This module attempts to brute force HTTP authentication against web servers.

#### Steps to Test:
1. Select the **auxiliary** module for HTTP brute-force:
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_login
    ```
2. Set the target URL, and wordlist:
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS <target-ip>
    set TARGETURI /admin
    set USER_FILE /path/to/userlist.txt
    set PASS_FILE /path/to/passwordlist.txt
    ```
3. Run the module:
    ```bash
    run
    ```

#### Tips:
- Always test for common login paths (`/admin`, `/login`, `/wp-admin`).
- Use different dictionaries for usernames and passwords.

### 3. **FTP Brute Force**
This auxiliary module attempts to brute-force FTP credentials.

#### Steps to Test:
1. Use the **FTP Brute Force** module:
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login
    ```
2. Set the target IP and the wordlist:
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS <target-ip>
    set USER_FILE /path/to/userlist.txt
    set PASS_FILE /path/to/passwordlist.txt
    ```
3. Execute the scan:
    ```bash
    run
    ```

#### Tips:
- Make sure to test for common FTP user credentials, e.g., `anonymous` or `ftpuser`.
- Use a smaller wordlist for faster scans and increase the list size for deeper testing.

### 4. **SMB Enumeration**
The SMB enumeration module helps to gather information about the SMB service on a target system.

#### Steps to Test:
1. Select the **SMB Enumeration** module:
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
    ```
2. Set the target IP:
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS <target-ip>
    ```
3. Run the scan:
    ```bash
    run
    ```

#### Tips:
- Useful for gathering SMB service versions and configurations.
- You can also use other SMB enumeration modules like `smb_enumshares` or `smb_enumusers` for deeper insight into the SMB service.

### 5. **VNC Brute Force**
This module is used to brute-force VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server passwords.

#### Steps to Test:
1. Select the **VNC Brute Force** module:
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login
    ```
2. Set the target IP and the wordlist:
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS <target-ip>
    set USER_FILE /path/to/userlist.txt
    set PASS_FILE /path/to/passwordlist.txt
    ```
3. Run the brute force scan:
    ```bash
    run
    ```

#### Tips:
- Common default credentials include `password`, `123456`, or `vncpassword`.
- Check the VNC server version with the `vnc_version` auxiliary to see if it has any known vulnerabilities.

### 6. **SMTP Brute Force**
This auxiliary module attempts to brute-force SMTP login credentials.

#### Steps to Test:
1. Select the **SMTP Brute Force** module:
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_login
    ```
2. Set the target IP and the wordlist:
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS <target-ip>
    set USER_FILE /path/to/userlist.txt
    set PASS_FILE /path/to/passwordlist.txt
    ```
3. Run the brute force attempt:
    ```bash
    run
    ```

#### Tips:
- Target the `smtp` service (commonly runs on port 25) for login brute-forcing.
- Use a list of likely usernames (e.g., email addresses) for better success.

### 7. **DNS Zone Transfer**
The DNS Zone Transfer module attempts to retrieve a zone file from a target DNS server, which can provide detailed information about the domain.

#### Steps to Test:
1. Select the **DNS Zone Transfer** module:
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/dns/dns_zone_transfer
    ```
2. Set the target domain:
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS <target-dns-server>
    set DOMAIN <target-domain>
    ```
3. Run the zone transfer attempt:
    ```bash
    run
    ```

#### Tips:
- Zone transfers are typically restricted, but some DNS servers might allow them. This could give an attacker a list of subdomains, IP addresses, and mail servers.
- Try common DNS servers like `8.8.8.8` (Google‚Äôs DNS) for external DNS zone transfers.

## Tips for Working with Metasploit Auxiliary Modules

1. **Choose the Right Wordlist**:
   - Use specific and targeted wordlists based on the service you're attacking (e.g., for SMTP or FTP).
   - Consider the size of your wordlist. A smaller wordlist will run faster but may not find all passwords.

2. **Scan and Explore First**:
   - Before using brute force, gather information using discovery modules (e.g., `nmap` or `portscan`).
   - Identify open ports and services before selecting which auxiliary modules to run.

3. **Use Proxies for Anonymization**:
   - If you‚Äôre scanning a target, consider routing traffic through a proxy like **Burp Suite** or **Tor** to anonymize your activity.

4. **Avoid Overloading Servers**:
   - Be mindful of the number of connections you're opening during brute-forcing. Too many threads may crash the target or alert security teams.

5. **Be Aware of Timeouts**:
   - Some services (like POP3, SMTP) may require additional time to respond during brute-forcing. Adjust timeouts (`set VERBOSE true`) to avoid premature timeouts.
